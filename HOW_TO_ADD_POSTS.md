# How to Add a New Blog Post 📝

Adding a new post is super easy! Just follow these simple steps:

## Step 1: Create a New File

In the `_posts` folder, create a new file with this naming pattern:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md
```

**Example:** `2025-11-09-my-weekend-adventure.md`

## Step 2: Add the Header

At the very top of your file, add these lines:

```
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title Here"
---
```

**Important:** Make sure to keep the three dashes (`---`) at the top and bottom!

## Step 3: Write Your Content

Below the header, write your post using markdown. Here are some helpful formatting tips:

### Headings
```
# Big Heading
## Medium Heading
### Small Heading
```

### Text Formatting
```
**bold text**
*italic text*
```

### Lists
```
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

### Links
```
[Link text here](https://example.com)
```

## Step 4: Save and Done! ✨

That's it! Save your file and Jekyll will automatically:
- Add it to the posts list page
- Create a link for people to read the full post
- Sort it by date (newest posts first)

## Example Post

Here's a complete example:

```
---
layout: post
title: "My First Post"
---
